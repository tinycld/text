// commentOwnerResolver maps a new text_comments row to the users a comment on
// that document belongs to: everyone who can reach the document.
//
// text_comments.author is a relation to users, so the engine's auto-detection
// would find it without this — but that scopes a personal rule to whoever
// wrote the comment, firing "when I comment" rather than the rule people
// actually want, "when someone comments on my document".
//
// Participants come from core (driveshare.ParticipantIDs) rather than being
// derived here. Text documents ARE drive_items, so the creator/share/suspension
// rules that decide who can open one live in drive's authorization code; a
// second copy in this package would drift from it, and an owner resolver that
// over-reports fires OTHER users' personal rules on a document they cannot
// see.
//
// Returns nil (never an error) on absent or malformed data so org-scoped rules
// still fire when no personal owner can be determined — the same contract
// mail's and calendar's resolvers follow.
