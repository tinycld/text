// use-mention-suggestions is a thin delegate to core's shared, bounded
// mention search (useMentionCandidates) — see that hook's own test
// (core/tests/unit/use-mention-candidates.test.tsx) for the
// role/disabled/prefix/cap coverage. What's worth asserting here is the
// delegation: the typed `@` query reaches the search verbatim, an
// editor mount's `canMention` capability gates it, the current user id
// passes through so the searcher is excluded from their own results,
// and — the regression this hook was rewritten for — that it renders
// at all with no EditorMountProvider above it.
