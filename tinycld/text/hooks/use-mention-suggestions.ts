// The @-mention picker's candidate hook for a document, delegating to
// core's shared, bounded mention search (`useMentionCandidates`) — see
// that hook's doc comment for why the predicate is a search (role +
// disabled + typed prefix, capped and ordered server-side) rather than
// a full-roster read.
//
// `query` is the text the user has typed after `@`, handed down by
// CommentComposer, which gets it from MentionInput's `onQueryChange`.
// An empty query runs no request at all: an @-mention popover that
// enumerates the roster the instant someone types `@` is exactly what
// the bounded search exists to prevent.
//
// The signature is `(query) => MentionSuggestion[]` and nothing else,
// because this is passed to CommentComposer AS a hook — see that
// component's `useMentionSuggestions` prop. Everything else it needs
// (the current user to exclude, whether mentions are allowed at all)
// comes from useEditorMount, so no caller has to bind arguments and
// the prop can stay a stable module-level function reference.
//
// A viewer mount reports `canMention: false`, which disables the
// search; guests must not enumerate the roster at all.
